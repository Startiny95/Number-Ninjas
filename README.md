## 🌟 Why This Project?

Customer churn directly impacts company revenue. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, telecom businesses can:

- Proactively retain customers
- Improve customer satisfaction
- Reduce marketing & retention costs

This dashboard was built as part of a **hackathon challenge** focusing on churn prediction using real-world telecom data.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **CSV File Upload** for customer data  
✅ **Churn Prediction** using trained **Random Forest Classifier**  
✅ **Downloadable Prediction Results**  
✅ **Interactive Visualizations**:
- Churn vs Retained distribution
- Monthly & Total Charges vs Churn
- Contract type, Device Protection, Tech Support impact
✅ **Top 10 High-Risk Customers List**  
✅ **Feature Importance Graph** (What features affect churn the most)

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Churn Distribution       | % of Churned vs Retained                              |
| Monthly Charges vs Churn | Higher charges → Higher churn probability             |
| Tenure vs Churn          | Shorter tenure → More likely to churn                 |
| Contract Type Analysis   | Month-to-month contracts → Higher churn risk          |
| Tech Support Impact      | Customers without tech support → More likely to churn |
| Top 10 Risk Customers    | List of most vulnerable customers with churn %        |
| Feature Importance       | What drives churn?                                    |
